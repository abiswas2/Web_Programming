				<h2>
					RESEARCH AND PROJECT:
				</h2>
				<p>
					The fourth-year college project that we chose was a line follower robot. The project objective was to create a robot that can detect visual indicators to follow a specific path. Additionally, our team also implemented obstacle avoidance along with line following wheeled autonomous Robot. Our team took the help of IEEE papers to create the design of the robot. The same was developed using a basic Atmega16 microprocessor and instructions were programmed using Embedded C language. IR sensors were used for visual indicators, 2 DC motors were used and connected to the microprocessor using L292D H-Bridge motor driver to get the inputs to control its movement. The project was documented and presented to an esteemed panel of college professors. The project was highly appreciated as it achieved all its objectives and also has additional features.
